# RebornMod

### RebornMod Leader
Vitiate (Worst then Caz honestly)

### Jurassic World Reborn is a prehistoric creature Mod, inspired by the classic dinosaur mod "JurassiCraft". While the mod carries several similarities to JurassiCraft, the code is not JurassiCraft's code, but our own property, having been entirely written by our coders.
